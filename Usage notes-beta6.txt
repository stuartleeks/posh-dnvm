dnvm alias
  Lists and manages aliases

usage:
  dnvm alias [-d] [<Name>] [<Version>] [<Architecture>] [<Runtime>]

options:
  -d                   Set this switch to delete the alias with the specified name
  <Name>               The name of the alias to read/create/delete

  <Architecture>       The architecture of the runtime to assign to this alias
  <Runtime>            The flavor of the runtime to assign to this alias

remarks:
  If no arguments are provided, this command lists all aliases. If <Name> is provided,
  the value of that alias, if present, is displayed. If <Name> and <Version> are
  provided, the alias <Name> is set to the runtime defined by <Version>, <Architecture>
  (defaults to 'x86') and <Runtime> (defaults to 'clr').
  Finally, if the '-d' switch is provided, the alias <Name> is deleted, if it exists.
  
  
  
  
  dnvm exec

  dnvm exec <VersionOrAlias> [<Command>] [-arch <Architecture>] [-r <Runtime>] [<Arguments>]

options:
  <VersionOrAlias>     The version of alias of the runtime to make active in the sub-shell
  <Command>            The command to execute in the sub-shell
  -arch
  -r
  <Arguments>
  
  
  
  dnvm help

usage:
  dnvm help [-PassThru]
  dnvm help <Command> [-PassThru]

options:
  <Command>            A specific command to get help for
  -PassThru
  
  
  
  
  
  dnvm install
  Installs a version of the runtime

usage:
  dnvm install [<VersionNuPkgOrAlias>] [-arch <Architecture>] [-r <Runtime>] [-a <Alias>] [-f] [-Proxy <Proxy>] [-NoNative] [-Ngen] [-Persistent] [-Unstable]

options:
  <VersionNuPkgOrAlias> The version to install from the current channel, the path to a '.nupkg' file to install, 'latest' to
install the latest available version from the current channel, or an alias value to install an alternate
runtime or architecture flavor of the specified alias.
  -arch                The processor architecture of the runtime to install (default: x86)
  -r                   The runtime flavor to install (default: clr)
  -a                   Set alias <Alias> to the installed runtime
  -f                   Overwrite an existing runtime if it already exists
  -Proxy               Use the given address as a proxy when accessing remote server
  -NoNative            Skip generation of native images
  -Ngen                For CLR flavor only. Generate native images for runtime libraries on Desktop CLR to improve startup time. This option requires elevated privilege and will be automatically turned on if the script is running in administrative mode. To opt-out in administrative mode, use -NoNative switch.
  -Persistent          Make the installed runtime useable across all processes run by the current user
  -Unstable            Upgrade from our unstable dev feed. This will give you the latest development version of the runtime.

remarks:
  A proxy can also be specified by using the 'http_proxy' environment variable
